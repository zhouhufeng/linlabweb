              ~~~~~~~~ SEMI-PARAMETRIC MIXED MODELS ~~~~~~~~


                             Version 1.0


                              Function: 

    This macro fits the following model to longitudinal Gaussian data:

         Yij = Xij*beta + f(tij) + Zij*bi + Ui(tij) + esp(ij),

  where beta is parametric fixed effects, f(.) is a smooth function, bi
  is random effects, Ui(.) is a Gaussian process, esp(ij) is the
  measurement error. Maximum penalized likelihood was used to estimate
  the beta and f(.), while smoohting parameter and the parameters in the
  variance matrix are estimated by REML method, which treats f(.) as an
  integrated Wiener process.

  Examples: 

    Here we used the progesterone data used in the paper cited in
  the Reference and fitted different models. All the models had random
  intercept, Gaussian stochastic process and measurement error. The
  differeces were the choice of the process. 

    There are usually three pages of output. The first page is about the model
  fitting information; the second page is about the variance components; the 
  third page is about linear fixed effects. Here we only gave all output for 
  AR(1) process, and gave only second page putput for other process.

    The estimated nonparametric function should be output using outsmth= and 
  its bands as well as SEs should be output using outband=. They can be plotted
  using S-plus or Proc GPLOT in SAS.  

    When there are continuous fixed effects covariates, for computational 
  stability, it is recomemded that these covariates be centered.

    c. interpretaion of the output:

       The first page of the putput is about the iteration history and the model 
     fitting information, where the REML Log Likelihood is the REML log 
     likelihood of the smoothing parameter and variance components, as well as 
     the linearity test, if requested.


       The second page is the estimates of 1/(smoothing parameter), called
     SMOOTH, and the parameters in the random effects, stochastic process and
     measurement error. The following is the meaning of the parameters: 

 
       SMOOTH   --- estimate of one over smoothing parameter
       D(1,1)   --- the (1,1)th element of D matrix of random effects
       AR       --- the correlation between two observations in AR(1) process
       Diag     --- marginal variance of the AR(1) process
       Residual --- the variance of the measurement error

    
       The third page contains the information about estimation and inference
     about beta in the linear fixed effects.  F_SE,  F_CHISQ, F_P are the
     standard error, chi-square, p-value from Frequentist inference, while
     B_SE, B_CHISQ, B_P are the standard error, chi-square, p-value from
     Bayesian inference.  


       At the end of each page, you can find the information about dependent
     variable, the variable that needs smoothed, linear fixed effects
     covariates, random effects covariates, the name of the Gaussian process
     and the corresponding variance function.
