<br />

Dr. Lin's research interests lie in the development and application of scalable statistical and machine learning methods for the analysis of massive data from the genome, exposome and phenome, including big and complex genetic and genomic, epidemiological and health data. Some examples of her current research include analytic methods and applications for large scale Whole Genome Sequencing studies, biobanks and Electronic Health Records, techniques and tools for whole genome variant functional annotations, analysis of the interplay of genes and environment, multiple phenotype analysis, polygenic risk prediction and heritability estimation. Additional examples include integrative analysis of different types of data, Mendelian Randomization, causal mediation analysis and causal inference, federated and transferred learning,  single cell genomics, analysis of epidemiological and complex observational studies, and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic data. Dr. Lin's theoretical and computational statistical research includes statistical methods for testing a large number of complex hypotheses, causal inference, statistical and ML methods for large matrices, prediction models using high-dimensional data, federated and transferred learning, cloud-based statistical computing, and mixed models, nonparametric and semiparametric regression, and statistical methods for epidemiological studies.
